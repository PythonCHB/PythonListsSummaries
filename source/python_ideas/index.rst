Python-ideas
============

python-ideas is a listserve that supports discussion of speculative language ideas for Python for possible inclusion into the language. If an idea gains traction it can then be discussed and honed to the point of becoming a solid proposal to create a PEP and discussed on python-dev as appropriate.

It can be found at:

https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-ideas

A great many ideas are discussed on the list -- some mature to the point of being written up as a PEP, and some of those are eventually added to the Python language or standard library.
These are well documented in the PEPS:
(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/)

But many other discussions result in a rejection of the idea, or peter out without a real conclusion. As many of these ideas are brought up again and again, these pages serve as a more digestible and searchable documentation of the ideas that have already been discussed on the list.
