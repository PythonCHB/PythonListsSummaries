I'm new to Python, where do I start?
####################################


Well learning Python as such requires learning 3 things:

* The core syntax and constructs
* In-built functions
* The standard library

The core syntax and constructs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python provides a tutorial `here <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`_

It's an awesome resource to get started. It's the official tutorial!

Built In Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python has many built-in functions to ease your life. You can view them `here <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html>`_

The standard library
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To get a full peak at the standard library, see `here <https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html>`_
