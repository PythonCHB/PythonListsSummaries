Python List Summaries
=====================

These pages serve to summarize some of the major discussions on the primary discussion lists for the Python Programming language.

The goal is for folks new to a list with a common question / issue to be able to find it here, rather than having to repeat the entire discussion once again.

This is a community supported project -- it will only be as good the level of contribution it receives.

If you are interested in contributing, these pages are manged on gitHub:
